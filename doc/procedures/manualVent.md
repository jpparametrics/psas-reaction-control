# Venting Procedure
## Notes
- The vent system definitely needs a choke, and probably a rudimentary diffuser.
    - The choke would limit the rate of discharge.
        - This would reduce damage from any FOD, thrust during venting, and limit expansion cooling to the choke.
        - It might be a good idea to put a cold sink on the choke.
        - During testing, we would defninitely want to monitor the temperature of the choke.
    - The diffuser would minimize the thrust produced by the venting procedure.
- On the vent system, we may want to add a pressure gauge between the coupling and the choke.
- "Caution" = potential damage to equipment
- "Danger" = potential damage to people and equipment.
- "FOD" = Foreign Object Debris (anything that shouldn't be there, e.g., dirt, metal shavings, grease, water, stray tools)

## Operations
### Preparation
1. Prepare the vent system.
    1. Ensure `BV-BTA` is closed. (TODO: orientation?)
    1. Ensure `NV-01` is closed. (TODO: orientation/instructions?)
    1. Remove the dust covers on both ends of the vent system.
    1. Ensure both ends are free of FOD. (TODO: cleaning procedure)
- Danger: 
    - When pressurized the RCS stores energy equivalent to (TODO) ?? kg of TNT. (safe radius (TODO) ?? m)
    - Anyone within (TODO) SAFE RADIUS must wear (TODO) REQUIRED PPE:
        - Impact-resistant safety goggles. (TODO: ANSI standard)
1. Prepare the RCS system.
    1. Remove the dust covers from the RCS system.
    1. Ensure both ends are free of FOD. (TODO: cleaning procedure)
- Danger: once the vent system is attached, it will be pressurized.
    - If `BV-VTA` is not closed, it may act like a thruster.
1. Attach the vent system to the RCS.
    1. Couple `HC-02` to `HC-01` such that there is an audible click. (TODO: update labels)
    1. Gently tug on `HC-02` to confirm the connection.

### Venting Proper
- Danger: 
    - If `NV-01` is not closed by the next step, the vent system may act like a thruster.
    - If the vent system contains FOD, the FOD may be violently discharged and/or damage internal components.
1. Open `BV-VTA`. (TODO: orientation)
2. Slowly open `NV-01` until a moderate hissing noise is heard. (TODO: direction/instructions, number of turns)
3. Retreat beyond (TODO) SAFE RADIUS from the RCS.
4. Wait for the hissing noise to stop.
5. Approach the RCS.
6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 of the "Venting Proper" procedure until `NV-01` is fully open and no hissing is heard.

### Tidying Up
1. Ensure the down-stream-end of the venting system and its dust cover are free of FOD. (TODO: cleaning procedure)
1. Cover the down-stream end of the venting system with its dust cover.
1. Close `HV-VTA`. (TODO: orientation)
1. Close `NV-01`. (TODO: direction/instructions)
1. If `HC-01` and `HC-01` covered in ice, wait for it to thaw and wipe off the moisture. 
   (TODO: the sides of the couplings need separate identifiers)
1. Ensure the dust covers for `HC-01` and `HC-01` are free of FOD. (TODO: identifiers)
- Danger: if pressure remains in the system, the next step may eject `HC-01` and/or any FOD present.
1. Decouple `HC-01` from `HC-01`.
1. Ensure `HC-01` and `HC-01` are free of FOD. (TODO: cleaning instructions)
1. Replace the dust covers on `HC-01` and `HC-01`.
